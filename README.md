## *Deep Reinforcement Learning and Residual Dynamics Modelling Pipelines for BlueROV2*

This repo contains the two learning-based strategies developed in the saabmarineMEX project:

### [`residual_modelling/`](./residual_modelling) 
Contains the training and inference pipeline for the residual dynamics modelling. 

### [`rl_training/`](./rl_training)
Contains the training pipeline for the Deep Reinforcement Learning control policy. The ros2 inference can be found in [saabmarineMEX_ros2](https://github.com/SAABmarine-MEX/saabmarineMEX_ros2).
